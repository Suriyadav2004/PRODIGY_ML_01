## Task 1 - Prodigy Infotech Data Science & Machine Learning Internship

This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict housing prices based on important features such as **square footage**, **number of bedrooms**, and **number of bathrooms**. It is part of my internship under the Data Science & Machine Learning domain at **Prodigy Infotech**.

## 📌 Project Objective

To develop a predictive model using **supervised machine learning** that accurately forecasts house prices based on given features. This helps stakeholders like buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and financial institutions make informed decisions.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given historical housing data, predict the **market price of a house** using:
- Square footage (Area)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

The aim is to use regression techniques to find the best fit line that models the relationship between the features and the target variable (price).

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – A clean dataset containing housing data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize and understand the relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding, and scaling.
4. **Model Building** – Train a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.
5. **Model Evaluation** – Metrics: R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE).
6. **Prediction** – Predict prices on test data and visualize results.
